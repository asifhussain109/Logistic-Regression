# Logistic-Regression
In this project I have used the RMS titanic dataset.
To predict survival of passengers traveling in RMS titanic using Logistic Regression.
Using feature engineering and onehotencoding we turned the dataset into a desirable dataset for the logistict regression model.
The accuracy score for the train is 0.8356741573033708 and accuracy score for test is 0.79329608938547, which is a good score.
